 * DaZeus is a simple and reliable IRC bot. It consists of the core bot, an
 * application written in C++ that exposes a socket interface, and plugins that
 * run in their own process and use the socket interface to connect to IRC.
 * Bindings are currently available in C, C++, Perl and Node.js.
 *
 * This is the documentation for DaZeus version @DAZEUS_VERSION@. An online
 * version of this documentation can be found at http://dazeus.github.com/; if
