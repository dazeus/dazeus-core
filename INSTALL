This application has the following dependencies:
	* libircclient (tested against 1.3)
	* libjson (tested against 7.4.1)
	* libmongo-client (tested against 0.1.4)

To compile DaZeus, copy the Makefile.in file and run make:

  cp Makefile.in Makefile
  make

This creates a 'dazeus' binary in the 'bin' directory that you can run. If you
intend to run DaZeus 2.0 elsewhere, you can manually copy the binary there.

If your dependencies are in nonstandard locations, you can alter the Makefile
after copying it to correctly set CFLAGS and LDFLAGS.
