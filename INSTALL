This application requires libircclient 1.3, which was released in 2009. It also
requires a recent version of Qt4.

To compile DaZeus, run qmake and make in the main directory:
  qmake
  make

This creates a 'dazeus' binary in the 'bin' directory that you can run. If
you intend to run DaZeus 2.0 elsewhere, you can manually copy the binary there.

If your dependencies are in nonstandard locations, you can alter the value of
the compilation or linker flags as follows:
  qmake -after QMAKE_CXXFLAGS+="-I/usr/local/include"
