This application has the following dependencies:
	* libircclient (tested against 1.3)
	* libjson (tested against 7.4.1)
	* libmongo-client (tested against 0.1.4)
	* cmake (tested against 2.8.7)

To compile DaZeus, use CMake:

  mkdir -p build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.. ..
  make install

This creates a 'dazeus' binary in the 'bin' directory that you can run. If you
intend to run DaZeus 2.0 elsewhere, you can manually copy the binary there, or
simply not give the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.. option to CMake if you want to
install DaZeus systemwide.
