This application requires libircclient 1.3, which was released in 2009. It also
requires a recent version of Qt4.

To compile DaVinci, run qmake and make in the main directory:
  qmake
  make

This creates a 'davinci' binary in the 'data' directory that you can run. If
you intend to run DaZeus 2.0 elsewhere, manually copy the 'data' directory
there.

For the Perl plugin (which is always enabled[0]) you need some Perl modules to
be installed: Data::Dumper, Storable and MIME::Base64. They are likely already
installed and otherwise it's probably easiest to install them via your package
manager. Otherwise, consult `man cpan`.
