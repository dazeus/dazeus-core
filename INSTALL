This application requires libircclient 1.3, which was released in 2009. It also
requires a recent version of Qt4.

To compile DaZeus, run qmake and make in the main directory:
  qmake
  make

This creates a 'dazeus' binary in the 'bin' directory that you can run. If
you intend to run DaZeus 2.0 elsewhere, you can manually copy the binary there.
