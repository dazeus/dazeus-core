# Doxyfile 1.2.12

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# General configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Perl modules"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. 
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = api

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag 
# can be used to strip a user defined part of the path. Stripping is 
# only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of 
# the path. It is allowed to use relative paths in the argument list.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        = .

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain 
# documented source files. You may enter file names like "myfile.cpp" or 
# directories like "/usr/src/myproject". Separate the files or directories 
# with spaces.

INPUT                  = .

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the 
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp 
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left 
# blank file matching one of the following patterns are included: 
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.c++ *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh *.hxx *.hpp 
# *.h++ *.idl

FILE_PATTERNS          = *.pm *.vb
