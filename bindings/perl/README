DaZeus version 1.00
===================

This is the installation directory for the DaZeus 2 Protocol Perl module. Using
this module, your modules can communicate with DaZeus as normal plugins.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make

   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the JSON module for its communication, available on CPAN.
JSON::XS is recommended for faster JSON communication, but not required. Also,
the module requires IO::Socket::UNIX if you want to do communication over UNIX
sockets, or IO::Socket::INET if you want to do communication over TCP sockets.
This module is tested against JSON 2.53, JSON::XS 2.32, IO::Socket::UNIX 1.23,
IO::Socket::INET 1.31 and Perl 5.12.3.
